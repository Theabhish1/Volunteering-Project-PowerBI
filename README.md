This solo Power BI project was undertaken as a self-initiative to deepen my understanding and expertise in Power BI. Through this project, I aimed to explore the tool's capabilities and enhance my skills in the following areas:

Data Modeling: Structuring data to establish relationships and ensure efficient analysis.
Data Cleaning: Preparing raw datasets for meaningful analysis by removing inconsistencies and errors.
Dashboard Preparation: Designing interactive and visually appealing dashboards to convey insights effectively.
This project allowed me to gain hands-on experience and a comprehensive understanding of Power BIâ€™s functionalities, reinforcing my ability to utilize it for data visualization and storytelling.
